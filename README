Various scripts I've written for my own personal use on my Linux boxes. 
Hopefully these are of some use to someone else.

=apt-undo= Parse apt history log and prompt user to remove packages installed by previous apt commands. 

For example, if you install jmeter and then realize that the jmeter that ships with Ubuntu is out of 
date and installs way too many dependencies, you can quickly run apt-undo, find the install log for your jmeter
install, and undo the install + all of the dependencies.

This has been tested minimally on Linux Mint 12 and Ubuntu 10.04. If in doubt, remove the "sudo" on the exec
or just answer the prompt with "echo" and run the apt-get remove yourself.
